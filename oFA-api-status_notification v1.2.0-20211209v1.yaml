        POST Resource Status.
    
        **Remark:** In case, where the ASPSP is only pushing a status hyperlink to the API client, the API client needs to check the resource status before informing e.g. the PSU
        
        **Side Effects**
        Creates a Resource Notification on the API client's server

          * 'received':
            An authorisation or cancellation-authorisation resource has been created successfully.
          * 'psuIdentified':
            The PSU related to the authorisation or cancellation-authorisation resource has been identified.
          * 'psuAuthenticated':
            The PSU related to the authorisation or cancellation-authorisation resource has been identified and authenticated e.g. by a password or by an access token.
          * 'scaMethodSelected':
            The PSU/TPP has selected the related SCA routine. 
            If the SCA method is chosen implicitly since only one SCA method is available, 
            then this is the first status to be reported instead of 'received'.
          * 'started':
            The addressed SCA routine has been started.
          * 'finalised':
            The SCA routine has been finalised successfully.
          * 'failed':
            The SCA routine failed
          * 'exempted':
            SCA was exempted for the related transaction, the related authorisation is successful.

    TransactionStatus:
      description: | 
        The transaction status is filled with codes of the ISO 20022 data table:
        - 'ACCC': 'AcceptedSettlementCompleted' -
          Settlement on the creditor's account has been completed.
        - 'ACCP': 'AcceptedCustomerProfile' - 
          Preceding check of technical validation was successful. 
          Customer profile check was also successful.
        - 'ACSC': 'AcceptedSettlementCompleted' - 
          Settlement on the debtor�s account has been completed.
          
          **Usage:** this can be used by the first agent to report to the debtor that the transaction has been completed. 
          
          **Warning:** this status is provided for transaction status reasons, not for financial information. 
          It can only be used after bilateral agreement.
        - 'ACSP': 'AcceptedSettlementInProcess' - 
          All preceding checks such as technical validation and customer profile were successful and therefore the payment initiation has been accepted for execution.
        - 'ACTC': 'AcceptedTechnicalValidation' - 
          Authentication and syntactical and semantical validation are successful.
        - 'ACWC': 'AcceptedWithChange' - 
          Instruction is accepted but a change will be made, such as date or remittance not sent.
        - 'ACWP': 'AcceptedWithoutPosting' - 
          Payment instruction included in the credit transfer is accepted without being posted to the creditor customer�s account.
        - 'RCVD': 'Received' - 
          Payment initiation has been received by the receiving agent.
        - 'PDNG': 'Pending' - 
          Payment initiation or individual transaction included in the payment initiation is pending. 
          Further checks and status update will be performed.
        - 'RJCT': 'Rejected' - 
          Payment initiation or individual transaction included in the payment initiation has been rejected.
        - 'CANC': 'Cancelled'
          Payment initiation has been cancelled before execution
          Remark: This codeis accepted as new code by ISO20022.
        - 'ACFC': 'AcceptedFundsChecked' -
          Preceding check of technical validation and customer profile was successful and an automatic funds check was positive .
          Remark: This code is accepted as new code by ISO20022.
        - 'PATC': 'PartiallyAcceptedTechnical'
          Correct The payment initiation needs multiple authentications, where some but not yet all have been performed. Syntactical and semantical validations are successful.
          Remark: This code is accepted as new code by ISO20022.
        - 'PART': 'PartiallyAccepted' -
          A number of transactions have been accepted, whereas another number of transactions have not yet achieved 'accepted' status.
          Remark: This code may be used only in case of bulk payments. It is only used in a situation where all mandated authorisations have been applied, but some payments have been rejected.

      description: |
        URI for the Endpoint of the TPP-API to which the status of the payment initiation should be sent. 
    
        This header field may by ignored by the ASPSP.
        
        For security reasons, it shall be ensured that the TPP-Notification-URI as introduced above is secured by the TPP eIDAS QWAC used for identification of the TPP. The following applies:
          
          URIs which are provided by TPPs in TPP-Notification-URI shall comply with the domain secured by the eIDAS QWAC certificate of the TPP in the field CN or SubjectAltName of the certificate. Please note that in case of example-TPP.com as certificate entry TPP- Notification-URI like www.example-TPP.com/xs2a-client/v1/ASPSPidentifcation/mytransaction- id/notifications or notifications.example-TPP.com/xs2a-client/v1/ASPSPidentifcation/mytransaction- id/notifications would be compliant.
          
          Wildcard definitions shall be taken into account for compliance checks by the ASPSP.
          ASPSPs may respond with ASPSP-Notification-Support set to false, if the provided URIs do not comply.

        The string has the form status=X1, …, Xn , where  Xi is one of the constants SCA, PROCESS, LAST and where constants are not repeated.
    
        The usage of the constants supports the following semantics:
    
        SCA: A notification on every change of the scaStatus attribute for all related authorisation processes is preferred by the TPP.
    
        PROCESS: A notification on all changes of consentStatus or transactionStatus attributes is preferred by the TPP.
    
        LAST: Only a notification on the last consentStatus or transactionStatus as available in the XS2A interface is preferred by the TPP
    
        This header field may be ignored, if the ASPSP does not support resource notification services for the related TPP

        This field must be provided if the ASPSP-Notification-Support=true. The ASPSP might consider the notification content as preferred by the TPP, but can also respond independently of the preferred request
